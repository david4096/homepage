# Decent Homepage source

This is the source repository for a decent homepage, hosted on ipfs.

It uses ipscend to publish and pandoc to convert markdown 
to hmtl.

Experimentally using [git-remote-ipfs](https://github.com/cryptix/git-remote-ipfs/) for a copy of this repository, 
currently having trouble cloning.

```
git remote add origin ipfs://ipfs/QmaB5xFYYTM4nw5kNWzzG6i5zBD1FhatMBhicXWghQwWuQ
```
