<h2>Conferences and Hackathons</h2>

Like many, I find myself at conferences and hackathons.

<li>RDF Summit 3</li>
<li>UCSC NCBI Hackathon</li>
<li>Biohackathon 2017</li>
<li>HTS/CRS Biocompute Object Conference</li>

<h2>Publications</h2>

I haven't published anything other than Software for a while.

<h2>Links to external sites</h2>

<h3>Other Homepages</h3>

I'm up for a decent Web ring, I don't already know of one, let me know of your
Homepage you'd like to link here!

<h4>Decent homepages</h4>

None, you have to get me a link.

<h4>Research home pages</h4>

The people listed here by no means approve of anything I say or do, but I link to 
them either out of admiration or envy. I'm definitely looking to build this list, 
especially if someone on your research team is trying out things in a decentralized way.

<li><a href="http://bionano.ucsf.edu/">Shawn Douglas Lab</a> is looking into making very small (molecular) things in new ways.</li>

<h4>Personal home pages</h4>

<li><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor beast of burden</a> is developing a new 
humane computing interface at <a href="https://dynamicland.org">dynamicland</a>.</li>

<h3>My other Web presence</h3>

<h4>Corporate Web</h4>

The web is re-decentralizing, so here are some links to places where I haven't 
yet deleted my account or been banned.

<h4>Dark web</h4>

Why does everyone think I have a darkweb presence? You can follow the discussion
on <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/37">integrating onion routing into the 
go-ipfs client</a>, which is what you'd need to get at this homepage over tor.
