go-ipfs client</a>, which is what you'd need to get at this homepage over tor.

<h2>Education and Work Experience</h2>

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

This website DOES NOT use cookies to track your activity. Since this Web site is hosted on 
the ipfs, it is subject to a variety of new attack vectors that may 
threaten your privacy. I'm not responsible if something bad happens with your personal 
data.

For example, since we only publish the keys for ipfs contents at first, it should be 
possible to identify the downloaders who access hashes that haven't been distributed 
throughout the network because our daemon is the only host.

Furthermore, if you visited this site using the `ipfs.io` service,  you should refer to <a href="https://ipfs.io/legal/">the ipfs.io 
legal policy on that</a>.

Web pages should be about getting you the information relevant to you, not collecting 
data on you, and this one will always strive for that.

<h2>Contact me</h2>

<p>The best way to contact me would be to use one of the above <a href="#corporate">Corporate Web links</a>. Email
isn't really yet decent.</p>
